      "summary": "I'm loving tech. I've always been interested in tech of all sorts. I do believe in people and 'the greater good'. That's why I'd like to contribute to society by improving the government. Especially the <i>digital</i> government. I'm employed at Kadaster, the Dutch Land and Mapping Agency for a while now and I'm working on innovation and emerging technologies to improve Kadaster and the government as a whole. Besides that I do have my own consultancy company by which I can share my knowledge and expertise outside government boundaries.",
